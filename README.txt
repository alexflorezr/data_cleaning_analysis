This files describe the procedures for the analyses:

1) Data was downloaded from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip to
the local "Downloads/Datacleaning" folder, subsequently spaces in the folder's name were removed

2) Folders named "Scripts" and "Results_tidydata" were created. The first one to save and
keep separated the new tidy data from the raw data and the second one to save the script,
code book and the Readme file
